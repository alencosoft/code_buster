    <string name="splash_activity_game_play_body">The game is similar to the old MasterMind game from the \'70s where two players try to guess a colored ball sequence in less turns than their opponent. This game, however, uses numbers (0-9) instead of colored balls with four slots. If you choose a correct number you will see a <font color="#666666">\"Gray\"</font> circle in the results list. If that same number is in the correct spot you will see a <font color="#00FF00">\"Green\"</font> circle. The game is over when you choose all four correct numbers and in their correct order (all <font color="#00FF00">\"Green\"</font> circles). A twist: this game is timed. If you finish quickly (few turns - less time) your score will be high and the reverse is true for a lower score. Good luck!</string>
